# NJ-ACCIDENTS


**INTRODUCTION**
  
  Road accidents are increasing nowadays this may be due to increase in number of vehicles on road every year. This leads to a serious negative effect such as property damage, injuries, financial implications, and sometimes even deaths. There are various causes for accidents like drunken drive, weather, traffic, high speed, bad road condition etc. which brings a great loss not only to family members but also for government and insurance companies. Road accident is a big issue that need to be analyzed and to take steps to reduce the number in future.


**OBJECTIVE**
  
  Exploratory data analysis using R tools to identify th e possible cause of accidents (such as driver, weather condition, pedestrian, vehicle condition, etc.) in New Jersey.


**ABOUT THIS DATASET**

1.	Downloaded data from NJTR
2.	Merged dataset of different years into one table.
